      <p class="intro-paragraph">At **Home Department**, we strive for transparency and fairness in all our financial transactions. This Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which refunds may be issued for payments made through our official portal. By making a payment, you agree to the terms laid out in this policy.</p>

      <h2>---</h2>
      <h2>1. General Refund Principles</h2>
      <p>This policy applies to payments made for specific services where a charge is explicitly levied, or for certain types of official transactions. It does not typically apply to voluntary donations unless otherwise specified or in cases of clear payment error. Our aim is to process all valid refund requests efficiently and fairly.</p>

      <h2>---</h2>
      <h2>2. Eligibility for Refund</h2>
      <p>Refunds may be considered under the following circumstances:</p>
      <h3>2.1. Payment Errors:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>**Duplicate Payment:** If the same transaction is processed multiple times for the same service due to a technical error.</li>
        <li>**Incorrect Amount:** If an amount significantly higher than the intended service fee was charged due to a system error.</li>
        <li>**Accidental Payment:** If a payment was made by mistake for a service not intended to be utilized, provided no service delivery has occurred.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2.2. Service Non-Delivery:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>**Service Not Provided:** If a paid service or official document application was confirmed but never delivered or initiated within the stipulated timeframe, and the delay is attributable to the Home Department.</li>
        <li>**Service Malfunction:** If a digital service paid for experiences a critical and persistent malfunction that prevents its use, and a resolution cannot be provided within a reasonable period.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2.3. Exceptional Cases:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Any other unique scenario where, upon review by the Home Department, a refund is deemed appropriate and fair.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>---</h2>
      <h2>3. Non-Refundable Items/Services</h2>
      <p>Generally, refunds will NOT be issued for the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>**Voluntary Donations:** Unless a technical error resulted in a duplicate or incorrect charge.</li>
        <li>**Successfully Delivered Services:** Once a service has been rendered, or an official document/application processed and completed as per the request.</li>
        <li>**User Error:** Payments made incorrectly due to user oversight (e.g., entering the wrong service code, applying for the wrong service, providing incorrect details that lead to service completion but with errors on the user's part).</li>
        <li>**Change of Mind:** If you simply change your mind after making a payment for a service that is otherwise ready for delivery or has already been initiated.</li>
        <li>**Third-Party Charges:** Any charges levied by your bank or payment gateway for the transaction.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>---</h2>
      <h2>4. Refund Request Time Frame</h2>
      <p>All refund requests must be initiated within **7 working days** (excluding public holidays) from the date of the original transaction. Requests received after this period may not be entertained.</p>
